## Installation

Youâ€™ll need to have [Node](https://nodejs.org) on your local development machine. It's preferable to use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to manage dependencies, running scripts, etc.

```sh
$ yarn install
```

Or if you are don't want to use Yarn (not recommended).

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Available scripts

### `yarn build` or `npm run build`
